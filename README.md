# TGI
Suppose you have some points, few of them, and you know they follow a non-linear function. Suppose for some reason you are not able to interpolate between them for several reasons. Suppose you have a lot of time to waste and you would like to read about this method I designed (I don't have that much time to waste but whatever). Here I present a geometrical way of generate new points using a very simple algorithm. I hope it may be of use for somebody!

WORK IN PROGRESS!
